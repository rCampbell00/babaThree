            Baba is You is a puzzle game where the aim is to
            get 'you' onto the winning tile. However, the rules
            for each level are included in the level space and
            can be changed as you play, so who 'you' is and what
            is the winning tile may differ at any point in a level.
        </p>
        <p>
            The main controls of the game are to use wasd to control
            'you' in the level. Moving into a block of text or any object
            with the 'push' rule will make the object move in the same direction,
            if it can. The main view for the game is the top-down view of the level
            and you can only move in this view. The arrows in the level can be clicked
            to get a side view of the level, to help see objects on top of each other.
            the 'q' key can be pressed to go back to top-down view. The 'z' key can be pressed
            to undo one move, and can be done for the last 200 moves. The 'Escape' key can be used
            to enter or exit the options menu.
